# SpringOrbit

SpringOrbit is a social media platform built using microservice architecture in Spring Boot. Each service is containerized with Docker, and the application can be started using Docker Compose. The front-end is built with React and TypeScript.

## Requirements

- Docker

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/OussamaMahjour/SpringOrbit.git
   cd SpringOrbit
   ```

2. Start the application with Docker Compose:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

   Note: Due to the number of containers, a service may not run because of memory constraints. If this happens, rerun the Docker Compose command.
